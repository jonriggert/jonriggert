# Husband | Dad | Cloud-Centric System Administrator, focusing on Automation & Project Leadership

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Bringing 15+ year of technical experience in Electronics, Audio-Visual, System-Cloud Administration, and Project Management. 

I didn‚Äôt take the traditional IT path‚ÄîI built my career from the ground up, starting in high-pressure live production environments before expanding into IT operations, cloud infrastructure, and automation.

That hands-on experience shaped how I approach technology today. I specialize in bridging the gap between enterprise IT, AV systems, and modern cloud solutions‚Äîoptimizing technology for large-scale organizations while leading teams, managing infrastructure, and driving automation.

Currently, as an IT Operations Supervisor, I oversee enterprise infrastructure, security, automation, and strategic technology planning. I thrive in environments where I can streamline systems, reduce downtime, and implement cloud-driven solutions that create real impact.

Key Strengths:

‚úî IT & Cloud Infrastructure (Azure, AWS, Microsoft 365)

‚úî Automation & System Optimization (Intune, Auto-Pilot, PowerShell, Python)

‚úî Enterprise AV & Networked Media (Teams Rooms, AV-over-IP, Digital Signage)

‚úî Leadership, Training & Project Management (Agile, Budgeting, Vendor Relations)

I know what it means to adapt, learn, and push forward in a constantly changing tech landscape. I‚Äôm excited about opportunities in IT leadership, cloud engineering, or enterprise infrastructure, where I can combine my technical expertise with problem-solving leadership. I‚Äôm seeking a dynamic role where I can utilize both my leadership abilities and hands-on technical skills to contribute to IT innovation and growth.
