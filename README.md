# Husband | Dad | Brining 15 Years of technical experience in Electronics, Audio-Visual, System Administration, and Project Management. 

My care for people and passion toward action drives an intentionality that can enhance your organization's ability to tell it's unique story; without compromising quality nor integrity - maintaining priorities and most importantly, values. 

I've had the privilege of working 15+ years around the world learning and serving toward a common goal: personal and professional transformation - aligning people and processes in order to achieve a greater potential. Whether in the setting of a non-profit, small business, or corporate enterprise.. let me be a part of your story. 

At the end of the day, I strive to be known as a servant leader who is grounded, present, and enjoying the journey. 

* What ultimately matters is not where you end up relative to your peers, but where you end up relative to yourself when you began. - David Malan
